# Bluenet workflow

The bluenet firmware can be found at <https://github.com/crownstone/bluenet>.

This repository contains my own workflow. No need to clutter that repository with my script files. :-)

The scripts in this repository are more or less a bunch of make commands in series. The alternative is
to look into your shell history.
